							<p>Lee Wade has been interested in Soccer as long as he can remember. He has been a fan,
							a referee, a player, and a coach (not an official coach but a coach) to his son when he was in soccer.
							Lee currently is an annual soccer player for the US Mens Soccer Team -- sporting under the Big Sun Adult 
							Soccer League. In this league he is an absolute soccer king who pwn's all other soccer players because
							they're noobs.</p>
